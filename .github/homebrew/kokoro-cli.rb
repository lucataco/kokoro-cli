    # Create a virtualenv and install kokoro-cli with all dependencies.
    # We use pip install with full dependency resolution rather than
    # virtualenv_install_with_resources (which requires manually listing
    # 50+ resource blocks) because kokoro-cli has a large native ML
    # dependency tree (MLX, numpy, spaCy, etc.).
    # Force source builds for Rust-backed extensions whose prebuilt macOS
    # wheels can fail Homebrew's Mach-O install_name rewrite step.

    <<~EOS
      kokoro-cli requires Apple Silicon (M1 or later) for MLX GPU acceleration.

      On first run, the Kokoro-82M model (~170MB) will be downloaded from
      HuggingFace and cached locally at ~/.cache/huggingface/.

      Quick start:
        kokoro --text "Hello world"
        echo "Hello world" | kokoro
        kokoro --list-voices

      Daemon mode (faster subsequent calls):
        kokoro serve --daemon
        kokoro --text "Near-instant speech"
        kokoro stop
    EOS
  end

  test do
    system libexec/"bin/python", "-c", "import pydantic_core"
    assert_match "af_sky", shell_output("#{bin}/kokoro --list-voices")
  end
end
